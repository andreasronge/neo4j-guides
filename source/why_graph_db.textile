h2. The advantage if a graph database

endprologue.

Why a graph database ? 
* Performance, here is a good summary by "Emil Eifrem, founder of the Neo4j":http://www.oscon.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8364

* Domain modeling: you use the language of node,properties and relationship to describe your
domain (instead of e.g. UML) and there is no need to have a complicated O/R mapping tool to implement it in your database.
You can say that Neo4j is  "Whiteboard friendly" !
